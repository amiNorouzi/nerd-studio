/**
 * `axiosClient` is an instance of `axios` with a custom configuration.
 * It uses the `create` method from `axios` to create the instance,
 * and the `use` method from `axios` to add an interceptor to the request pipeline.
 *
 * The `axiosClient` has the following configuration:
 * - `baseURL`: The base URL for the API, which is taken from the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
 * - `headers`: The headers for the requests, which include the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.
 *
 * The `axiosClient` has a request interceptor that adds the `Authorization` header to the requests if there is a current session.
 * The `Authorization` header is set to `Bearer ${session.user.accessToken}`, where `session.user.accessToken` is the access token from the current session.
 * The interceptor uses the `getSession` function from `next-auth/react` to get the current session.
 *
 * If there is an error during the execution of the interceptor, it returns a rejected promise with the error.
 *
 * @returns {AxiosInstance} The `axiosClient` instance.
